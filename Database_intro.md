# Database introduction

## Levels of abstraction

### Physical Level
It decides how the data is being stored in the physical servers of the database.
### Logical Level
It decides how the database is logically stored (Schema and how the relationship between multiple tables are present in the databse)
### View Level
This is the level which is seen in the application. Like what we see on every website. No need for every data in the db to be displayed, just the data that is needed can be displayed.

## Schema and Instance

### Schema
Blueprint of how the database should be structured
### Instance
The records are that are in the table / db is called the instace

## Data Models

### Relational Model
### ER
### Object based model
### semi-strucuted model (XML)

## DDL and DML

### DDL - Data definition language
It is used to define the schema of a table. What type a column can be. What are the contraints that needs to be applied (like 
balance cannot be negative)
### DML - Data Manipulation Language
It is used to create, update and delete records in a table (SQL).
