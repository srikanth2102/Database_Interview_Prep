# Database introduction

## Levels of abstraction

### Physical Level
It decides how the data is being stored in the physical servers of the database.
### Logical Level
It decides how the database is logically stored (Schema and how the relationship between multiple tables are present in the databse)
### View Level
This is the level which is seen in the application. Like what we see on every website. No need for every data in the db to be displayed, just the data that is needed can be displayed.
